        <h2 class="sub-heading">Shimla</h2>
        <p class="post-text">Shimla is the capital of Himachal Pradesh and a popular hill-station among Indian families and honeymooners. Situated at the height of 2200m, Shimla was the summer capital of British India. Shimla still retains its old-world charm with beautiful colonial architecture, pedestrian-friendly Mall Road and the ridge lined up with multiple shops, cafes and restaurants.</p>

        <p class="post-text">Shimla is well connected with many cities and is just 4 hours from the nearby city of Chandigarh. The city has an airport as well; however, there aren't many daily flights from here. The railway station connects Shimla with the plans and is famous for the Kalka-Shimla train route; a UNESCO listed World Heritage site.</p>

        <p class="post-text">The weather is pleasant for most of the months with tourists flocking especially during the summer months. The winters are cold with some days of snow from mid-December till February end.</p>

        <p class="post-text"> Shimla is often covered along with nearby towns of Kufri, a hill-station almost always covered by snow and Chail, famous for a huge palace and the highest cricket ground in the world. Tourists also visit the famous Jakhu Temple and engage in sightseeing at various viewpoints during their trip to Shimla.</p>
