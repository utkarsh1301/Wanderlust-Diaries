        <p class="post-text">Dehradun is the capital city and the largest city of Uttarakhand. Dehradun is located at an altitude of 1400 feet above sea level and has a pleasant climate all year round. Located just 30kms from Mussoorie, Dehradun is known as the gateway to Mussoorie and Rishikesh and Haridwar. Dehradun is also known as the "Educational Hub of Uttarakhand" with some of the country's prestigious universities and boarding schools.</p>

        <p class="post-text">As you would expect from a city located in the foothills of the Himalayas, Dehradun abounds in caves, waterfalls and natural springs. One such popular spot is Robber's Cave, which is a natural cave surrounded by hills. Dip your feet in the ice-cold water or walk through it - travellers are free to take their pick, making Robber's Cave one of the most popular picnic spots in the city. Another popular spot for nature lovers is Lacchiwala, where you can sit and enjoy a relaxing sunset around the man-made lake and the lush greenery around it. Lacchiwala also has arrangements for trekking and birdwatching if you're up for it.</p>
